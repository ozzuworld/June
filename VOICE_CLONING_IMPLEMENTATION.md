## üéµ Voice Cloning Workflow

### 1. Upload Reference Audio
```bash
curl -X POST "http://june-tts:8000/clone-voice" \
  -F "files=@reference1.wav" \
  -F "files=@reference2.wav" \
  -F "name=John Smith" \
  -F "description=Professional narrator" \
  -F "language=en"
```

**Response:**
```json
{
  "voice_id": "abc123def456",
  "name": "John Smith", 
  "status": "created",
  "duration": 45.2,
  "file_count": 2
}
```

### 2. Synthesize with Cloned Voice
```bash
curl -X POST "http://june-tts:8000/synthesize-clone" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "text": "Hello, this is my cloned voice speaking!",
    "language": "en",
    "voice_id": "abc123def456"
  }' \
  --output cloned_voice.wav
```

### 3. Cross-Language Synthesis
```bash
curl -X POST "http://june-tts:8000/synthesize-clone" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "text": "Bonjour, je parle fran√ßais avec une voix anglaise clon√©e!",
    "language": "fr", 
    "voice_id": "abc123def456"
  }' \
  --output french_with_english_voice.wav
```

### 4. LiveKit Room Publishing
```bash
curl -X POST "http://june-tts:8000/publish-to-room" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "room_name": "ozzu-main",
    "text": "Publishing cloned voice to LiveKit room!",
    "voice_id": "abc123def456",
    "language": "en"
  }'
```

## üîß Configuration & Deployment

```

## üß™ Testing Voice Cloning

### 1. Health Check with New Features
```bash
curl http://june-tts:8000/healthz
```

**Expected Response:**
```json
{
  "status": "healthy",
  "service": "june-tts", 
  "tts_ready": true,
  "voice_cloning": true,
  "cached_voices": 0,
  "features": [
    "built-in speakers",
    "voice cloning", 
    "cross-language synthesis",
    "speaker caching",
    "livekit integration"
  ]
}
```

### 2. List Available Voices
```bash
curl http://june-tts:8000/voices | jq
```

### 3. Test Voice Cloning End-to-End
```python
import requests

# 1. Upload voice
files = [("files", ("ref.wav", open("reference.wav", "rb")))]
data = {"name": "Test Voice", "language": "en"}
response = requests.post("http://june-tts:8000/clone-voice", 
                        files=files, data=data)
voice_id = response.json()["voice_id"]

# 2. Synthesize with cloned voice
payload = {
    "text": "This is a test of voice cloning!",
    "voice_id": voice_id,
    "language": "en"
}
audio = requests.post("http://june-tts:8000/synthesize-clone", 
                     json=payload)

# 3. Save result
with open("cloned_output.wav", "wb") as f:
    f.write(audio.content)
```

## üîÑ Integration with Orchestrator

The orchestrator service has been enhanced to support voice cloning:

```python
from app.services.tts_service import tts_service

# Use cloned voice in orchestrator
async def process_with_cloned_voice(text: str, voice_id: str):
    # Direct synthesis
    audio_bytes = await tts_service.synthesize_with_voice_clone(
        text=text,
        voice_id=voice_id,
        language="en"
    )
    
    # Or publish directly to room
    success = await tts_service.publish_to_room(
        room_name="ozzu-main",
        text=text,
        voice_id=voice_id,
        language="en"
    )
    
    return success
```

## üìä Performance & Quality Guidelines

### Voice Quality Optimization
- **Reference Duration**: 10-30 seconds per file (optimal)
- **Multiple Files**: Use 2-5 files with varied speech patterns
- **Audio Quality**: 24kHz, clear speech, minimal background noise
- **Content Variety**: Include questions, statements, emotions

### Performance Considerations  
- **GPU Acceleration**: ~200ms synthesis with GPU
- **CPU Fallback**: ~1-2 seconds synthesis with CPU
- **Memory Usage**: ~2-4GB per concurrent voice cloning request
- **Storage**: ~1-5MB per stored voice (depending on reference duration)

### Cross-Language Quality
- **Best Results**: Similar language families (English ‚Üí Spanish)
- **Good Results**: Different families with shared phonemes
- **Accent Retention**: Original voice accent is preserved

## üö® Migration from Previous Version

### Existing Code Compatibility
All existing code continues to work unchanged:

```python
# This still works exactly as before
response = requests.post("http://june-tts:8000/synthesize-binary", 
                        json={
                            "text": "Hello world",
                            "speaker": "Claribel Dervla", 
                            "language": "en"
                        })
```

### Gradual Migration Path
1. **Phase 1**: Deploy enhanced service (backward compatible)
2. **Phase 2**: Start using voice cloning for new features  
3. **Phase 3**: Migrate existing workflows to custom voices
4. **Phase 4**: Optimize with cross-language capabilities

## üîê Security & Validation

### Audio File Validation
- ‚úÖ File format validation (WAV, MP3, FLAC, M4A)
- ‚úÖ Duration validation (6-300 seconds)
- ‚úÖ Sample rate validation (16kHz minimum)
- ‚úÖ Content validation (single speaker detection)
- ‚úÖ Size limits (reasonable file sizes)

### Voice Management Security
- ‚úÖ Unique voice ID generation
- ‚úÖ Voice isolation (each voice in separate directory)
- ‚úÖ Secure file storage with proper permissions
- ‚úÖ Input sanitization for names and descriptions

## üìà Monitoring & Observability

### New Metrics Available
- Voice cloning requests per minute
- Stored voice count and storage usage
- Cross-language synthesis usage
- Voice cache hit rates
- Audio processing latencies

### Logging Enhancements
