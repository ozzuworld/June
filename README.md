# June â€” Cloud-agnostic Terraform Skeleton

This folder provides a provider-agnostic layout so you can switch between GCP/AWS (and later Azure)
with minimal code changes. Your **app** should deploy via GitOps (Argo/Flux) or Helm, while Terraform
handles platform primitives (network, cluster, registry, DNS, object storage, KMS/Secrets).

## Structure

```
infra/
  modules/                 # cloud-agnostic interfaces (variables/outputs only)
  providers/
    gcp/                   # concrete GCP implementations
    aws/                   # concrete AWS implementations (partial example)
  envs/
    gcp/                   # backend + providers + wiring for GCP
    aws/                   # backend + providers + wiring for AWS
```

## Quick start (GCP)

```bash
cd infra/envs/gcp
terraform init
terraform apply -auto-approve
$(terraform output -raw kube_client_cmd)  # get kubeconfig
```

## Quick start (AWS)

```bash
cd infra/envs/aws
terraform init
terraform apply -auto-approve
$(terraform output -raw kube_client_cmd)  # get kubeconfig
```

> Fill in `terraform.tfvars` in each env with your project/account IDs, regions, and desired node pools.
