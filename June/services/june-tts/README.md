## üéõÔ∏è Advanced Features

### Multiple Reference Files for Better Quality

```python
# Use multiple reference files for higher quality voice cloning
files = [
    "speaker_sample_1.wav",  # Neutral speech
    "speaker_sample_2.wav",  # Excited speech
    "speaker_sample_3.wav",  # Question intonation
    "speaker_sample_4.wav",  # Slow and clear
]

result = clone_voice(files, "High Quality Voice", "Multiple reference samples")
```

### Cross-Language Voice Transfer

```python
# Clone an English voice, then speak in Spanish
english_voice = clone_voice(["english_ref.wav"], "English Speaker")
voice_id = english_voice["voice_id"]

# Now synthesize Spanish text with English voice characteristics
spanish_audio = synthesize_cloned(
    "Hola, soy un hablante de ingl√©s hablando espa√±ol",
    voice_id, 
    language="es"
)
```

### Real-time Processing Optimization

```python
# For real-time applications, use shorter reference audio and caching
def optimize_for_realtime(voice_name, reference_audio):
    # Use single, high-quality 10-15 second reference
    result = clone_voice([reference_audio], voice_name)
    
    # Voice is now cached for fast synthesis
    return result["voice_id"]

# Subsequent synthesis calls will be ~200ms
voice_id = optimize_for_realtime("RT Voice", "short_reference.wav")
audio = synthesize_cloned("Real-time synthesis!", voice_id)
```

## üîç Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **Audio too short error**: Ensure reference audio is at least 6 seconds
2. **Poor voice quality**: Use higher quality reference audio (24kHz+, clear speech)
3. **Cross-language accent**: This is expected - the cloned voice retains original accent
4. **Memory issues**: Reduce concurrent requests or use CPU-only mode
5. **LiveKit connection failed**: Verify API keys and websocket URL

### Performance Tips

- Use GPU acceleration for faster processing
- Cache frequently used voices
- Use multiple shorter reference files instead of one long file
- Pre-process audio to remove silence and noise
- Monitor memory usage with multiple concurrent voice cloning requests

## üìä API Response Formats

### Success Responses

```json
{
  "voice_id": "abc123def456",
  "name": "Custom Voice",
  "status": "created",
  "duration": 25.4,
  "file_count": 3,
  "message": "Voice successfully cloned and stored"
}
```

### Error Responses

```json
{
  "detail": "Audio too short: 4.2s. Minimum 6 seconds required, 10+ recommended."
}
```

## üîí Security Considerations

- Validate all uploaded audio files
- Implement rate limiting for voice cloning endpoints
- Store voice files securely with proper access controls
- Monitor disk usage for voice storage
- Sanitize voice names and descriptions

This enhanced TTS service provides enterprise-grade voice cloning capabilities while maintaining the simplicity and performance required for real-time applications.
