# June TTS Service - Minimal TTS-only dependencies
# Remove STT/ASR stack (WhisperX/faster-whisper/pyannote) since this is a TTS service

# Web Framework
fastapi==0.104.1
uvicorn==0.24.0
python-multipart
httpx==0.25.2

# LiveKit Integration (if used by TTS streaming)
livekit==0.11.1

# Core ML/TTS deps (adjust to your engine; keep only what june-tts actually uses)
# Torch is installed via Dockerfile with CUDA wheels
# torchaudio used for audio I/O and saving
# transformers only if your TTS model or tokenizer needs it
# Remove if unused to slim image
transformers>=4.30.0,<5.0.0

# Audio Processing
soundfile==0.12.1
scipy>=1.11.0,<2.0.0
librosa>=0.10.0,<1.0.0

# NOTE:
# - Removed whisperx and faster-whisper to avoid PyAV/FFmpeg-dev/Cython complications.
# - Removed pyannote.audio (ASR alignment/diarization library)
# - If your TTS engine (e.g., F5-TTS/CosyVoice components) needs extra packages
#   like pydub, sentencepiece, add only those explicitly required by june-tts/main.py.
